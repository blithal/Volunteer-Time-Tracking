# volunteer_time_tracking

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started
Before running the program, install the Flutter extension in VSCode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBgCgHBMR3c
The video also shows how to run a program in Flutter. However, our app requires you to set up your backend before running the app. To do this:
1) using Terminal/Command prompt, navigate to the "backend/library" directory within our project
2) enter the command "python3 manage.py runserver". If that causes an error, try "python manage.py runserver". If that doesn't work, make sure your python version is up to date. https://www.python.org/downloads/
3) Once your server is running, you can run the program from VSCode and it should launch your app onto your web browser
4) To login, the username is "user" and password is "password". To login to admin account. username is "User" and password is "password"
